My name is Weiqiu You (尤玮秋). I am a second year Master student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst working with Prof. Mohit Iyyer.

My past research mainly focuses on machine translation, along with text summarization, information retrieval. For future research, I am broadly interested in investigating natural language processing and machine learning, with specific focuses on controlled text generation, machine translation, multilinguality, multimodal, and low-resource languages.
