My name is Weiqiu You (尤玮秋). I have just graduated as a Master student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst and was very fortunate to have worked with Prof. Mohit Iyyer. I'm currently doing an internship at USC/ISI working with Prof. Jonathan May. I am excited to become a PhD student at UPenn and to work with Prof. Mark Yatskar.

My past research mainly focuses on machine translation. For future research, I am broadly interested in investigating natural language processing and machine learning, with specific focuses on the intersection between natural langauge processing and computer vision, multilinguality, and low-resource scenarios.
